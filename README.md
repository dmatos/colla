CollA Project (www.joubertlima.com.br/colla) How can you and your
friends register several machines to create a virtual supercomputer?
In the virtual environment, how can you invite new friends, submit
jobs or tasks, upload data and analyze results collaboratively?
At DECOM-UFOP, we have a collaborative platform, named CollA.
CollA is easy to use and install. CollA users can invite new friends,
write chats, create groups, register machines, including machines
with invalid IPs, upload files and execute jobs coded using Java
or JavaC치&L치 APIs. Several private groups can share a collaborative
infrastructure, thus inexpensive solutions to big problems can be
addressed using CollA, since CollA is a virtual supercomputer over
several commodity PCs. CollA team is composed by professors and
students of UFOP and Technological Institute of Aeronautics (ITA).
CollA future plans include: full integration with JSensor and C치&L치
Parallel Programming projects, enabling to simulate and execute Java
or C++ parallel or distribute jobs, using CPU or GPU instructions.
New services, like Business Intelligence, must be offered to CollA
users. CollA must have portable Web and mobile GUIs. Finally, we need
improvements in our software development process.
